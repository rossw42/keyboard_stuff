# MX Switches Research Database

*Comprehensive research database of MX stem mechanical keyboard switches*

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive research database of MX stem mechanical keyboard switches, organized for easy comparison and analysis. The database covers 400+ switches across 12 major manufacturers with detailed specifications, sound profiles, and characteristics.

Because apparently I needed to catalog every single way to make a plastic cross go *click*. What started as "I just want a nice keyboard" turned into documenting 400+ switches because somehow choosing between "clicky" and "not clicky" wasn't confusing enough.

## üéØ How to Use This Database
