# Keyboard Stuff

This repository consolidates various keyboard-related projects and utilities.

> **Disclaimer**: I'm not really a programmer, I just play one on GitHub. This entire repo is a perpetual work-in-progress that will probably never be "finished" - much like my quest for the perfect keyboard layout. Expect things to be broken, half-implemented, or completely abandoned as I chase the next shiny keyboard idea. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Contents

- **ergogen/** - Keyboard layout generation using Ergogen, plus DXF viewers and related tools (when I can figure out how YAML works)
- **keyboards/** - Keyboard configurations and layouts (spoiler: most don't compile)
- **qmk_utilities/** - Utilities for working with QMK firmware (emphasis on "utilities" not "working")
- **switch_research/** - Research and documentation on mechanical keyboard switches

## Structure

Each subfolder contains its own project with individual documentation. Check the README files in each directory for specific usage instructions - assuming I remembered to write any.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the specific project folder you're interested in and follow the instructions in its README file. If something doesn't work, that's probably normal. If something does work, that's probably an accident.

## Status

Forever and always: üöß **WORK IN PROGRESS** üöß

_"It's not a bug, it's a feature I haven't implemented yet."_
