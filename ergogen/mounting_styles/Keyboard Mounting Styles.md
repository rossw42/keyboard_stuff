## Summary of Keyboard Mounting Styles

### What is a Mounting Style?

A keyboard's mounting style defines how the plate or PCB is secured within the keyboard housing. This fundamental design choice significantly affects the typing feel, sound profile, assembly method, and overall experience of the keyboard. The mounting style determines how forces are transmitted when keys are pressed and how vibrations are dampened or amplified.

### Main Categories

Mounting styles fall into two primary categories:

- **Case Mounting**: PCB/plate attached directly to the keyboard case
- **Tray Mounting**: PCB/plate attached to a separate tray/bottom plate within the case

Additionally, keyboards can be designed as:

- **Plate Mount**: Uses a separate mounting plate
- **Plateless Mount**: No plate, switches mount directly to PCB

### Detailed Mounting Styles

#### 1. Tray Mount

**Description**: PCB is secured to the bottom housing via screw-in pins/posts. Most common in entry-level keyboards.

**Characteristics**:

- Screws pass through plate and PCB to bottom case
- Standardized screw positions
- Simple, cost-effective design

**Pros**:

- Very cost-effective
- Highly standardized and DIY-friendly
- Easy to manufacture
- Good for beginners

**Cons**:

- Stiff typing experience
- Inconsistent key feel across the board
- May not utilize high-quality components effectively

**Ergogen Implementation**: Simple case design with standardized mounting posts. Requires minimal custom geometry.

#### 2. Top Mount

**Description**: Plate is secured to the top housing of the keyboard case.

**Characteristics**:

- Plate has mounting tabs/holes that attach to top case
- Screws typically go through top case to secure assembly
- Popular in mid to high-end keyboards

**Pros**:

- Consistent typing feel
- Better key response than tray mount
- Durable build quality
- Works with various plate materials

**Cons**:

- Higher cost than tray mount
- More complex assembly
- Typically harder at edges, softer in middle
- Non-standardized mounting points

**Ergogen Implementation**: Requires custom plate design with mounting tabs. Case needs corresponding mounting points in top shell.

#### 3. Bottom Mount

**Description**: Plate is secured to the bottom housing instead of top housing.

**Characteristics**:

- Plate attaches to bottom case edges
- Allows for suspended/floating top case design
- More consistently stiff than top mount

**Pros**:

- Solid, stable feel
- More uniform rigidity
- Allows suspended case designs
- Better support for softer plate materials

**Cons**:

- Less common, fewer options
- Can feel overly rigid
- Requires custom plate design

**Ergogen Implementation**: Plate design with bottom-mounting tabs. Case requires mounting points in bottom shell with clearance for top shell.

#### 4. Sandwich Mount

**Description**: Screws pass completely through bottom housing, plate, and top housing, "sandwiching" the plate between case halves.

**Characteristics**:

- Plate is compressed between top and bottom case
- Even force distribution across plate
- Requires precise alignment

**Pros**:

- Balanced typing experience
- Good acoustic properties
- Even force distribution
- Pleasant, muffled sound profile

**Cons**:

- Complex assembly process
- Requires precise alignment
- More challenging to manufacture

**Ergogen Implementation**: Requires through-holes in plate that align with case mounting points. Precise tolerances needed.

#### 5. Integrated Plate

**Description**: Plate and top housing are manufactured as one piece.

**Characteristics**:

- Plate is part of the top case
- Usually CNC machined from single piece
- Very rigid construction

**Pros**:

- Extremely sturdy and durable
- Simplified construction (fewer parts)
- Unified aesthetic
- Cost-effective for mass production

**Cons**:

- Very rigid, no flex
- Can be heavy
- No plate customization options
- Higher CNC costs for custom designs

**Ergogen Implementation**: Single-piece top case/plate design. Requires switch cutouts directly in case geometry.

#### 6. Gasket Mount

**Description**: Uses gasket material (rubber/foam) between plate and case on top and bottom sides.

**Characteristics**:

- Plate "floats" on gaskets
- No direct metal-to-metal contact
- Screws only connect case halves

**Pros**:

- Superior cushioning and comfort
- Excellent sound dampening
- Consistent typing feel
- Reduced ping and resonance
- Premium typing experience

**Cons**:

- Higher cost due to custom gaskets
- More complex assembly
- Requires precise gasket design
- Maintenance of gasket materials

**Ergogen Implementation**: Requires gasket channels in both case halves. Plate needs gasket contact surfaces. Most complex to design properly.

#### 7. Spring Mount

**Description**: Springs provide cushioning and support for PCB and plate.

**Characteristics**:

- Springs integrated into mounting system
- Provides dynamic response
- Less common mounting style

**Pros**:

- Sound dampening
- Cushioned, responsive feel
- Unique typing experience

**Cons**:

- Complex to design and assemble
- Higher cost
- Less common, fewer resources

**Ergogen Implementation**: Requires spring mounting points and careful spring selection for proper force curves.

#### 8. Plateless Mount

**Description**: No mounting plate - switches mount directly to PCB.

**Characteristics**:

- Switches rely entirely on PCB for support
- Can be combined with other mounting styles
- Requires precise PCB design

**Pros**:

- Unique elastic typing feel
- Direct force transmission to PCB
- Potential cost savings

**Cons**:

- Requires high-precision PCB
- Limited hot-swap compatibility
- Potential alignment issues
- Less switch stability

**Ergogen Implementation**: Requires very precise switch cutouts in PCB. No plate geometry needed, but PCB must be more robust.

### Ergogen Implementation Considerations

#### Design Complexity (Easiest to Hardest):

1. **Tray Mount** - Standard mounting posts
2. **Integrated Plate** - Single-piece design
3. **Top/Bottom Mount** - Custom plate tabs
4. **Sandwich Mount** - Through-hole alignment
5. **Gasket Mount** - Gasket channels and sealing
6. **Spring Mount** - Spring integration points

#### Key Design Elements for Ergogen:

**Case Design**:

- Mounting post locations and sizes
- Gasket channels (for gasket mount)
- Screw boss placement
- Wall thickness considerations

**Plate Design**:

- Mounting tab geometry
- Gasket contact surfaces
- Flex cuts (for desired flexibility)
- Material thickness optimization

**PCB Considerations**:

- Mounting hole placement
- Structural reinforcement areas
- Component clearances

### Recommendations for Different Use Cases:

**Gaming**: Top mount or gasket mount for responsiveness and comfort
**Typing**: Gasket mount for comfort, or sandwich mount for consistent feel
**Budget Builds**: Tray mount for cost-effectiveness
**Premium Builds**: Gasket mount for ultimate experience
**Beginner DIY**: Tray mount for simplicity and standardization

The choice of mounting style significantly impacts the final keyboard experience and should be considered early in the design process, as it affects case geometry, plate design, and overall assembly complexity.
