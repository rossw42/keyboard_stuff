# keyboards

Welcome to the digital equivalent of that junk drawer in your kitchen - you know, the one with the dead batteries, random screws, and that thing you're pretty sure is important but can't remember why.

> **Warning**: This folder has more cobwebs than a haunted house and changes more often than my mind about which switches I actually like. Enter at your own risk. üï∑Ô∏è

## What's Probably In Here (Subject to Change Without Notice)

### VIA/QMK Keymaps 
- JSON files for various keyboards that may or may not work
- `keymap.c` files that definitely worked... once... on a Tuesday
- `rules.mk` files with `VIA_ENABLE = yes` because who has time for compiling?

### 3D Files That May or May Not Print
- `plate.3mf` - A switch plate that looked good in the slicer
- Various `.scad` files for cases that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM
- STL files that are probably the right scale (no promises)

### Ergogen Configurations
- `Lintilla.yaml`, `forestv0.3.1.yaml`, `forestv3.yaml` - Keyboard designs in various states of "almost working"
- YAML files that generate PCBs that may actually fit the cases (fingers crossed)
- Some configs are "borrowed" from other people's projects while I learn how this stuff works (thanks, internet strangers!)

### Random Hardware Configs
- `config.h` files with pin definitions that worked on my specific setup
- `info.json` files with layouts that are definitely correct (until they're not)
- `mcuconf.h` files that enable the magic smoke to stay inside the chips

### Documentation (Loosely Defined)
- READMEs for specific keyboards that I'll update "eventually"
- Notes about modifications that seemed brilliant at the time
- Troubleshooting guides for problems I've definitely solved before

## Usage Philosophy

This is my personal keyboard graveyard/laboratory/treasure chest. Files appear and disappear based on:
- Whether I'm currently obsessed with that particular keyboard
- If I remembered to commit changes before switching projects
- The phase of the moon
- How much coffee I've had

## Disclaimer

- **Nothing is guaranteed to work** - but hey, that's half the fun!
- **Files may vanish** - I reorganize this folder like I reorganize my desk (chaotically and often)
- **Compatibility is a suggestion** - your mileage may vary wildly
- **Documentation is aspirational** - I'll write proper docs "next time"

## Contributing

Feel free to add your own keyboard chaos to this collection! Just remember:
- Label things clearly (unlike me)
- Test your configs (also unlike me)
- Document your changes (definitely unlike me)
