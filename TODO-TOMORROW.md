# TODO for Tomorrow - DXF Viewer Testing & Improvements

## üß™ Primary Testing Tasks

### 1. Test New Sidebar Layout
- [ ] **Load extension** (F5 in VS Code from `ergogen/ergogen-toolkit` folder)
- [ ] **Open DXF viewer** on the macropad project (`ergogen/keyboards/macropad/config_4x5/`)
- [ ] **Verify sidebar layout** - file list on left, viewer on right
- [ ] **Test file selection** - click each file in sidebar, verify it displays
- [ ] **Check visual feedback** - hover effects, selection highlighting
- [ ] **Verify entity info** - entity counts and types display correctly

### 2. Functionality Verification
- [ ] **Test all 5 DXF files** (case_outline, numpad, pcb_outline, plate, switchplate)
- [ ] **Verify SVG rendering** - graphics display correctly in viewer area
- [ ] **Check error handling** - test with corrupted/missing files if possible
- [ ] **Test file switching** - rapid clicking between files works smoothly
- [ ] **Verify placeholder** - empty state shows when no file selected

### 3. Performance & Polish Testing
- [ ] **Check responsiveness** - layout adapts to different webview sizes
- [ ] **Test with many files** - create more DXF files to test scalability
- [ ] **Verify memory usage** - switching files doesn't cause memory leaks
- [ ] **Check styling consistency** - VS Code theme integration looks good

## üîß Potential Improvements to Consider

### UI/UX Enhancements
- [ ] **Add zoom controls** - zoom in/out buttons for detailed viewing
- [ ] **Add pan functionality** - drag to pan around large DXF files
- [ ] **File search/filter** - search box to filter file list
- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** - arrow keys to navigate file list
- [ ] **File details panel** - show more metadata (creation date, entity breakdown)

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] **Lazy loading** - only parse DXF when file is selected (performance)
- [ ] **Caching** - cache parsed entities to avoid re-parsing
- [ ] **Better error messages** - more specific error types and solutions
- [ ] **Progress indicators** - show loading state for large files
- [ ] **Export functionality** - save SVG or PNG of current view

### Integration Improvements
- [ ] **Auto-refresh** - watch for new DXF files and update list
- [ ] **Ergogen integration** - button to run Ergogen and refresh viewer
- [ ] **File context menu** - right-click options (open in external viewer, etc.)
- [ ] **Workspace integration** - remember last selected file per workspace

## üêõ Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Problems
- [ ] **JavaScript errors** - check browser console for any JS issues
- [ ] **SVG rendering issues** - complex arcs or polylines might not render correctly
- [ ] **File path issues** - verify file paths work on different operating systems
- [ ] **Large file handling** - test with files approaching the 5MB limit
- [ ] **Entity parsing edge cases** - malformed DXF entities might cause crashes

### Fallback Plans
- [ ] **If sidebar breaks** - revert to simple vertical layout as backup
- [ ] **If JS fails** - ensure basic HTML-only version still works
- [ ] **If SVG fails** - show entity list as text fallback
- [ ] **If performance issues** - add more aggressive limits or lazy loading

## üìã Success Criteria for Tomorrow

### Must Have (Critical)
- ‚úÖ **Sidebar layout works** - files on left, viewer on right
- ‚úÖ **File selection works** - clicking files displays them
- ‚úÖ **SVG rendering works** - keyboard graphics display correctly
- ‚úÖ **No crashes** - extension remains stable during testing

### Should Have (Important)
- ‚úÖ **Professional appearance** - looks polished and modern
- ‚úÖ **Good performance** - smooth file switching, no lag
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - graceful handling of problematic files
- ‚úÖ **Entity info display** - shows useful metadata about each file

### Nice to Have (Bonus)
- ‚úÖ **Responsive design** - works well at different sizes
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard shortcuts** - basic navigation without mouse
- ‚úÖ **Visual polish** - animations, smooth transitions
- ‚úÖ **Accessibility** - screen reader friendly, good contrast

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

### If Testing Goes Well
1. **Package extension** - solve the vsce packaging issue
2. **Create documentation** - README with screenshots
3. **Add more features** - zoom, pan, export functionality
4. **Optimize performance** - lazy loading, caching

### If Issues Found
1. **Debug and fix** - address any critical issues first
2. **Simplify if needed** - remove complex features that don't work
3. **Test iteratively** - fix one issue at a time
4. **Document workarounds** - note any limitations
